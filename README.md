# Minecraft Club
Just a way to organize my curseforge projects, as well as scripts, configs, and mods I frequently use. 
Helpful if you wanna join, update, or modify my modpacks.
Currently Supported Projects:
  - Create: Cobblemon*
  - Don't Starve
  - NotCasual (mostly discontinued)**

I DO NOT CLAIM ANY FORM OF OWNERSHIP FOR THESE MODPACKS OR THE MODS THEY CONTAIN.
Notice: Starlight will NOT be supported on this repo, as it is not "my" project***
  *(NOT in .zip form because of pack size, temporarally extracted (although it does consume storage))
  **(Still here for Archival purposes, only one .zip is present to retain storage)
  ***(see https://github.com/MasterPichu32/Advanced_Origins_mod and fork https://github.com/JustAModScientist/AdvancedLore_starlight)
